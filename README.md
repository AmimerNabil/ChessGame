# ChessGame

Hello everyone! This is my first Repo where I make everything Public. 
The goal of this project is really just to remember the basics of java before I head out to school. 

I try to follow an "MVC" (Model View Controller) design pattern. I believe that it is the simplest and msot effective pattern to 
follow to make a chess game. I make everything from scratch using Java's graphical library "JavaFX". 

If anyone stunbles upon this project, don't hesitate to give advice about my coding style and whatever I should improve. 


!!!!-------------------------------!!!
As for the game controller and the movements for each pieces. I know that it was done in a sloppy manner. I will correct that as soon as I have time. 

Thank you, 
Nabil.
